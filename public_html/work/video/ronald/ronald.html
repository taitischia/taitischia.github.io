  <span class="header">Here is a letter I wrote to Ronald McDonald recently.</span>
<p>&quot;Dear Ronald,</p>
  <p>I love you. I really do. You’ve been like a father to me over the years and for that I think you deserve respect. Sometimes I think you’re cooler than Jesus, but even He got it wrong occasionally. I know, I know - you’re just a couple of dudes searching for meaning in a strange world. I do see the similarities between Judas and The Hamburglar for example. You think you can trust a guy and what does he do? Betrays you/steals your junior burger. That sucks.</p>
  <p>But today I have a pickle to throw at you and I’m afraid it might stick on the window to your soul. For that I apologise, but I think you need to hear me out.</p>
  <p>Yesterday (Sunday April 13, 2009) I was refused a Happy Meal™. I know. WTF? I was served by Jane, a man-ish looking beast from some distant planet, maybe Zorgona, or another similar moon. I was polite and asked why my age could not be accommodated. To this she replied in a deep and humiliating delivery, “aren’t you a little old, buddyyyy?”</p>
  <p>Those words were like eye-lasers eating my mind. I’ve been eating Happy Meals™ since I was eight, and I don’t plan to stop now. I may be twenty-three, but I still have the entire set of 101 Dalmations™ toys from 1998. Doesn’t that count for something? I plan to use Pongo and Perdita on the top of my wedding cake. I don’t have a wife yet but when I do I know it will be a Happy Day™. As you can see, Happy Meals™ are a big part of my identity, so I hope you can appreciate how upset this made me.</p>
  <p>I did some research on the interweb and found that in 2004 you invented a Happy Meal™ for adults named Go Active!™ I’m glad I never saw one of these because it confuses me. Why would an adult want a Happy Meal™ that tells me what I should be doing? I want to be happy, not active. And no toy? At least you could have made the pedometer look like, I don’t know, Krang from the Ninja Turtles or something. I hope this was a funny joke. If it was, I was pleasantly amused.</p>
  <p>Sorry Ronald, I just thought you should know what happened and I didn’t know who else to tell. Maybe you could send me some coupons. If not, I am missing the ‘Gonzo’ Happy Meal™ toy from the popular 1996 film Muppet Treasure Island. He’s tied to a mast and has a pink crayon box. I was in hospital at the time and they didn’t have McDonalds.</p>
  <p>Oh, and fire Jane. She works at Mooroolbark McDonalds and looks like a man. You’ll know her when you see her.</p>
  <p>Yours truly,</p>
  <p>Tait Ischia&quot;</p>
  <p>I sent it in the mail to a Mr. Peter Bush, the CEO of McDonalds Australia. I thought that he'd have to know Ronald personally, seeing as he runs the business and all.</p>
  <p>So to make sure Mr. Bush passed it on, I left a small note inside the envelope along with the letter.<br />
    <br />

  <p><br />
    Just today I got a response. Not from Ronald, but from Laura Aubusson, the Customer Service Coordinator at McDonalds Australia.<br />
  </p>
  <p>I thought maybe Ms. Aubusson is a pseudonym Ronald uses when speaking to his fanbase. Because that way he'd get less return mail. And he could relate 'one-on-one' with his followers.  </p>
  <p>So I looked the name up on Facebook. I don't know which one she is but none look like Ronald. How disappointing.<br />

  If anyone knows how I could get the ‘Gonzo’ Happy Meal™ toy tied to a mast with a pink crayon box, please let me know at <a href="mailto:&#116;&#64;&#116;&#97;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#115;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">t@taitischia.com</a>. I will trade you one of my doubles.</p>
