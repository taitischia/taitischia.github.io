				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://taitischia.com/blog/2012/07/19/dozo/autosave-file-vom-d-lab23-der-agfaphoto-gmbh/" rel="attachment wp-att-881"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-881" title="Autosave-File vom d-lab2/3 der AgfaPhoto GmbH" src="http://taitischia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bluepantsmagee.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>On my second trip to Japan, standing next to a large bush of hydrangeas, I caught a fragrant whiff of its sprawling ancient culture. It&#8217;s sprawling because I imagine it like the endless suburbs of six-storey apartments, hundreds-of-thousands, maybe millions, bleeding into the horizon, piled on top of each other.</p>
<p>For over 2,000 years Japan has been generating people. 35 million live in greater Tokyo today. They&#8217;ve been making new human beings with new ideas for a long time.</p>
<p>In comparison, Australia has been its current anglo-shaped nation for 250 years. 4 million people live in greater Melbourne, a much emptier city filled with Italians, Greeks, Chinese, Vietnamese, Irish, English—ancient cultures that have coalesced into walking ideas, trying to get along, watching American television in a moderate climate, debating whether the Sudanese should stay.</p>
<p>In the early days, Japanese culture appropriated bits of Chinese, Korean and Indian cultures. Now they just call it Japanese. Buddhism, India&#8217;s great export, is unmistakably Japanese, in its own Zen way, for chrissakes.</p>
<p>So when a third-generation Greek named George asks a second-generation Italian named Don for a cigarette, walking the main street in the outer Eastern suburbs of Mooroolbark—where the Wurundjeri once stood and made their plans—thousands of years fly through their fingertips, one lighting the flame, the other raising the stick to his lips. George exhales and lets the smoke trail off into the distance, only disappearing visually, but remaining as particles in the air for others to breathe, to whiff, their lungs to filter.</p>

<p>Below the concrete, under the waves of rolling automobiles, knowledge sways from mahogany bookshelves.</p>
<p>Schools of well-to-do librarians duck and weave, putting this there, that over here, and <em>oops</em>, up off the ground, and back on top.</p>
<p>They stop in the corridors to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen that gentleman devouring the knowledge at the large reading table?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Every week. Peculiar. What&#8217;s he read?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elevators transfer knowledge to the room above as it is called for. A bell rings. A door opens. And people are served.</p>
<p>They feast on the knowledge. Gobble it up. Smoosh their faces in its pages and swallow it whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delicious!&#8221; They say. &#8220;This knowledge is the very best. But where does it come from? I only ever hear that little bell ring, that little door open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Under your feet is an elaborate eco-system. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fascinating. Just fascinating. There&#8217;s nothing better than this here knowledge. Nothing better at all.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It took me a few days to realise it was all complete tripe. I sounded like an idiot. The metaphors. The semi-colons. The <em>italics</em>. What bullshit. Pretty hilarious though, when you think about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still don&#8217;t understand you. You keep justifying this shit to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doing it cause you <em>need the money</em>. You&#8217;re doing it cause <em>that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to do</em>. Who fucking cares?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah I know, but&#8230; I. Arg&#8230; I need the money. I can&#8217;t do what I want without it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Write. Everyday. Don&#8217;t worry about the money. It&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Godammit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an idiot. Clever, but an idiot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The easiest mistakes are the ones that come naturally. You try to catch your brain in the act; with its <em>pants down</em>. And you do. It&#8217;s always funny. Hilarious actually. Pretty hilarious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Untitled by risa-i, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-rocksteady/5449086879/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5099/5449086879_6e10a6a2d5_z.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="406" /></a></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-rocksteady/5449086879/">Image by Risa-i</a></em></p>
<p>When I was 16, I&#8217;d sit on the bus to school, staring out the window.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine discussions with various people: girls I liked, idols to meet, teachers to prove wrong. The conversations would flow effortlessly, like bird formations in the sky. I&#8217;d say exactly what I felt; what I <em>meant</em>. I was the centre of the goddam universe and others listened to me. I was in control of everything.</p>
<p>But reality was the opposite. I was clunky and shy around girls, idols, teachers. When I spoke, conversations stumbled. Something was blocking the flow. I was a cliche of awkward youth. Just another one of <em>those,</em> I suppose.</p>
<p>Then I found a solution. A blank page.</p>
<p>With it, I&#8217;d fall into that mesmerising pool of window-flow, and document the journey. I&#8217;d write in my voice and find form for the discussions. Relief! Soon everyone would hear what I had to say. Girls would fall at my feet, idols would become friends, teachers would concede defeat, then resign.</p>
<p>But achieving window-flow was a boulder and a hill. I couldn&#8217;t hold it long enough to finish a story. Girls never fell at or near my feet.</p>
<p>So I forgot about it and did the stuff you should do: Left home. Worked. Saw the things to see.</p>
<p>Now, close to ten years later, I&#8217;ve almost got it. The flow stays long enough to write, consistently. I&#8217;m saying the things I want to say. Relief.</p>
<p>Today I moved into a new office space. I sat in my chair and stared at a vent in the wall until this came out. Flaburg! Just like that.</p>
<p>Vent-flow, I call it. Always have, always will.</p>

<p>Recently, I left my job.</p>
<p>I was the Creative Director at <a href="http://nativedigital.com.au" target="_blank">Native Digita</a>l&#8211;a neat little agency in a warehouse with a table tennis table. It took about a year to realise making arrangements and being an expert in technology wasn&#8217;t my bag. I&#8217;m a copywriter by trade. The skills just didn&#8217;t fit. So I left.</p>
<p>I thought my mum would hate me, but she didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Oh, Tait, well, sounds like you made a good decision. Do you want lasagna? I can get Tim to drop some off.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget how much jobs don&#8217;t matter. No one cares what you do. Anyone who does is a doormat.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m a writer. Wa-hoo.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best word I&#8217;ve found for what I&#8217;m good at. I&#8217;m gonna run with it while I can.</p>
<p>Each week, I&#8217;ll be splitting my time between copywriting for clients and writing features for magazines. I&#8217;ve been making arrangements for a year now (aka, writing emails, quickly) so I think I can do this (aka, making money, quickly).</p>
<p>You know, last Monday I climbed that giant hill of Hobart, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wellington_(Tasmania)">Mt. Wellington</a>. Armed with a pair of vans and a backpack containing a mandarine and a half-finished bag of nuts, myself and three others reached the peak. It was -4 and we were wearing tshirts. And that, dear friends, was all the advice I needed to pay rent as a writer.</p>
<p><strong><em>End note: <a href="http://nativedigital.com.au" target="_blank">Native Digital</a> are the very best digital agency in Melbourne. If you&#8217;re into start-ups, apps, websites, digital strategies, or making cool stuff, get in touch with ned@nativedigital.com.au, and tell him I sent you.</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sitting in the lounge of his two-bedroom flat, Cecil listened to the fire. The sound of metal expanding and wood turning to coal tinkered in the background. He breathed deeply and wiggled his bum, trying to relax in the brown leather chair. Today had been an important day. His only son Mark had just been married.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A voice pokes Cecil in the back. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Cecil?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Yes?” He asks, turning around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Would you like a glass of gin?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“That’d be great, thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Cecil cupped the glass of gin, he wondered why he&#8217;d never imagined Mark might one-day be married. He had only ever thought about life within his own world. For whatever reason, Mark had never truly made it inside. You might think this would cause Cecil some stress, but he liked it that way. It made things simpler. And Cecil was a simple kind of guy. Mark on the other hand, was not so simple. He was a complex and embittered thinker. Mark also liked things this way. He saw no joy in simplifying the world. He liked Woody Allen films and books by Russian authors. It’s what made him, him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cecil sat some more, drumming his fingers against the glass of gin, attempting to turn off his brain. This is what Cecil calls &#8216;meditating&#8217;; a process he likes to practice often. After a moment, he closes his eyes, and opens his mouth to speak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“June, why did we get a divorce?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Oh Cecil. You’re as stupid now as you were then.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">June is sitting on the couch with her legs crossed&#8211;her own glass of gin resting safely on the armrest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Thanks June. You’ve still got it, you know that?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You asked.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Yes, I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p1">Hesitating, slowly, June continued.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You know exactly why we divorced.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I know why we divorced, but I still don’t understand why, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“No, I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Forget about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“<em>This</em> is why we divorced.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cecil and June had been separated five years before they signed those fateful papers. They told their closest friends they&#8217;d decided to wait until Mark had finished school but it was really because they couldn’t face the weight of failure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Mark doesn’t know what he’s in for.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Oh shut-up Cecil. He’ll be fine. Julie’s a lovely girl. She’s got her head screwed on.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“What are you trying to say? That as long as Julie’s got her head screwed on they’ll be happy forever?&#8221; Cecil let out a forced half breath. &#8220;You might be right, seeing as we’re divorced and you’re as nutty as they come.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You’re a stupid fucking cunt sometimes Cecil.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I remember why we got divorced now.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Just drink your gin and keep meditating.”</span></p>

<p>Oh how better life would be,</p>
<p>If all ideas made us laugh,</p>
<p>or want to be happy,</p>
<p>or be a better parent,</p>
<p>or spend less money,</p>
<p>or relax, ax, ax, ax,</p>
<p>or climb a tree,</p>
<p>or read a book,</p>
<p>or talk in front of a roaring fire,</p>
<p>or dance with friends to a record player,</p>
<p>or eat fresh food,</p>
<p>or have friends for dinner,</p>
<p>or ride bicycles to the sea,</p>
<p>or just enjoy being with &#8216;me&#8217;.</p>
<p>Oh how great life would be,</p>
<p>if we got rid of the ad agency,</p>
<p>and took everyone&#8217;s money,</p>
<p>to make piano keys out of everything.</p>
<p>Maybe soon.</p>
