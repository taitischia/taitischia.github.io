<p>Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking.<br />
And when she passes, each one she passes goes, &#8220;Ahh.&#8221;<br />
When she walks, she&#8217;s like a samba that swings so cool and sways so gently.<br />
That when she passes, each one she passes goes, &#8220;Ahh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ooh, but he watches so sadly.<br />
How can he tell her he loves her?</p>
<p>Yes he would give his heart gladly,<br />
But instead when she walks to the sea,<br />
She looks straight ahead not at he.</p>

<p>Ooh, but he watches so sadly.<br />
How can he tell her he loves her?</p>
<p>Yes he would give his heart gladly,<br />
But each day, when she walks to the sea,<br />
She looks straight ahead, not at he.</p>
<p>Tall, and tan, and young, and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking.<br />
And when she passes, he smiles&#8211;but she doesn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>She just doesn&#8217;t see.</p>

<p><em>The song was inspired by Heloísa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto, a fifteen-year-old girl living on Montenegro Street in the fashionable Ipanema district in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Daily she would stroll past the popular Veloso bar-café, not just to the beach, but in the everyday course of her life. </em></p>
<p><em>She would sometimes enter the bar to buy cigarettes for her mother and leave to the sound of wolf-whistles. In the winter of 1962 the composers watched the girl pass by the bar, and it is easy to imagine why they noticed her — Helô was five-foot eight-inchs, brunette, and she attracted the attention of many of the bar patrons. </em></p>
<p><em>In </em>Revealed: The Real Girl from Ipanema<em> Moraes wrote she was:</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;the paradigm of the young Carioca (a native inhabitant of Rio): a golden teenage girl, a mixture of flower and mermaid, full of light and grace, the sight of whom is also sad, in that she carries with her, on her route to the sea, the feeling of youth that fades, of the beauty that is not ours alone — it is a gift of life in its beautiful and melancholic constant ebb and flow.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>- &#8211; - &#8211; -</p>
<p><em>On March 18, 1963, Stan goes into the studio to record “Getz/Gilberto”. Joao Gilberto (Astrud&#8217;s husband) was almost pathologically shy, and refuses to leave his hotel room to go to the studio. Stan&#8217;s wife goes to his hotel and pleads with Gilberto to go. The only Brazilian fluent in English present at the session was Gilberto’s wife, Astrud. Stan asks her to sing “Corcodavo” and “The Girl From Impanema”. She has no training or experience, but Stan likes her voice. </em></p>
<p><em>“Gilberto and Jobim didn’t want Astrud on it. Astrud wasn’t a professional singer; she was a housewife. But when I wanted translations of what was going on, and she sang &#8216;Ipanema&#8217; and &#8216;Corcodavo&#8217;, I thought the words in English were very nice. And Astrud sounded good enough to put on the record.”</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;d sampled the wares of others too long,</p>
<p>Until I came to find this song.</p>
<p>And there I found a world so deep,</p>
<p>So deep I could no longer see my feet.</p>
<p>But I can feel them, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re planted firmly on the floor.</p>
<p>Now all I gotta do is learn to walk,</p>
<p>Then sing, and dance, and sway, and talk.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda funny, you know,</p>
<p>All those times I put on a show.</p>
<p>I forgot who I was.</p>
<p>The only reason; just because.</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s my only regret,</p>
<p>But now I&#8217;ll never forget.</p>
<p>For when I&#8217;m down and beat,</p>
<p>All I need to feel is my feet.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t write this joke. I read it in a newspaper I found on the train.</p>
<p>- -</p>
<p><em><span>A big chess tournament was taking place at the Plaza in New York. After the first day&#8217;s competition, many of the winners sat in the hotel foyer bragging about their skillful play. As they had more to drink, they started getting louder and louder, until the desk clerk couldn&#8217;t take any more. He kicked them out.</span></em></p>
<p><em>The next morning the Manager called the clerk into his office. He had received many complaints about the clerk&#8217;s rudeness to the chess players. The Manager said, &#8220;Boy, you were wrong to kick those players out. You should have just asked them to be less noisy.&#8221;</p>
<p></em></p>
<p><em>The clerk responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but if there&#8217;s one thing I can&#8217;t stand, it&#8217;s chess nuts boasting in an open foyer.&#8221; </em></p>

 <h1 style="font-size:100px;"><a href="http://taitischia.com/blog/2010/12/15/cecil/">Cecil.</a></h1>		
<div class="post">
<p>Sitting in the lounge of his two-bedroom flat, Cecil listened to the fire. The sound of metal expanding and wood turning to coal tinkered in the background. He breathed deeply and wiggled his bum, trying to relax in the brown leather chair. Today had been an important day. His only son Mark had just been married.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A voice pokes Cecil in the back. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Cecil?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Yes?” He asks, turning around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Would you like a glass of gin?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“That’d be great, thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Cecil cupped the glass of gin, he wondered why he&#8217;d never imagined Mark might one-day be married. He had only ever thought about life within his own world. For whatever reason, Mark had never truly made it inside. You might think this would cause Cecil some stress, but he liked it that way. It made things simpler. And Cecil was a simple kind of guy. Mark on the other hand, was not so simple. He was a complex and embittered thinker. Mark also liked things this way. He saw no joy in simplifying the world. He liked Woody Allen films and books by Russian authors. It’s what made him, him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cecil sat some more, drumming his fingers against the glass of gin, attempting to turn off his brain. This is what Cecil calls &#8216;meditating&#8217;; a process he likes to practice often. After a moment, he closes his eyes, and opens his mouth to speak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“June, why did we get a divorce?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Oh Cecil. You’re as stupid now as you were then.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">June is sitting on the couch with her legs crossed&#8211;her own glass of gin resting safely on the armrest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Thanks June. You’ve still got it, you know that?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You asked.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Yes, I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p1">Hesitating, slowly, June continued.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You know exactly why we divorced.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I know why we divorced, but I still don’t understand why, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“No, I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Forget about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“<em>This</em> is why we divorced.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cecil and June had been separated five years before they signed those fateful papers. They told their closest friends they&#8217;d decided to wait until Mark had finished school but it was really because they couldn’t face the weight of failure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Mark doesn’t know what he’s in for.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Oh shut-up Cecil. He’ll be fine. Julie’s a lovely girl. She’s got her head screwed on.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“What are you trying to say? That as long as Julie’s got her head screwed on they’ll be happy forever?&#8221; Cecil let out a forced half breath. &#8220;You might be right, seeing as we’re divorced and you’re as nutty as they come.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You’re a stupid fucking cunt sometimes Cecil.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I remember why we got divorced now.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Just drink your gin and keep meditating.”</span></p>

<p><strong><em>There once was a man named <a href="http://www.cstadvertising.com/blog/" target="_blank">Trott</a>. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Who liked short sentences a lot. </em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>who logged onto his blog, </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>turned into a staccato snot.<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><em>- Me</em></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;What we need, then, is practice in handling long sentences.  It is  relatively easy to feel confident in writing shorter sentences, but if  our prose is made up entirely of shorter structures, it begins to feel  like &#8220;See Dick run. See Jane jump.  See Jane jump on Puff.&#8221; Primer style  (pronounced &#8220;primmer&#8221; in the U.S.A.), it&#8217;s called, and it would drive a  reader crazy after a while.&#8221; </strong></em></p>
<p><em>- <a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/sentences.htm" target="_blank">Sentence Variety</a></em></p>
<p>Advertising does short sentences well because there aren&#8217;t many copywriters who write interesting long sentences.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no jibe, it&#8217;s a challenge.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Say you need to design an umbrella stand. Some sort of tubular object immediately comes to mind. But Fukasawa insists that we should eliminate this idea. He says all we should do is cut a groove 8mm wide and 5mm deep into the concrete floor at the building&#8217;s entrance. Visitors looking for a place to put their umbrellas would be quick to look for a spot to stick the top end. As if the umbrella itself were on the prowl for a place to stand, it would no doubt easily discover the groove that had been set there in anticipation, and all the umbrellas would stand in a neat row. And yet people using it may have no idea that the groove is an umbrella rack. The orderly row of umbrellas would be the result of unconcious behaivour. Fukasawa rests his case: the umbrella rack design is complete unto itself.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;An affordance is a quality of an object, or an environment, that allows an individual to perform an action.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;If an actor steps into a room with an armchair and a softball, Gibson&#8217;s original definition of affordances allows that the actor may throw the recliner and sit on the softball, because that is objectively possible. Norman&#8217;s definition of (perceived) affordances captures the likelihood that the actor will sit on the recliner and throw the softball. Effectively, Norman&#8217;s affordances &#8220;suggest&#8221; how an object may be interacted with. For example, the size and shape of a softball obviously fits nicely in the average human hand, and its density and texture make it perfect for throwing. The user may also bring past experience with similar objects (baseballs, perhaps) to bear when evaluating a new affordance.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Norman&#8217;s adaptation of the concept has seen a further shift of meaning, in which the term </em><em>affordance is used as an uncountable noun, referring to the property of an object or system&#8217;s action possibilities being easily discoverable, as in &#8220;this web page has good affordance,&#8221; or &#8220;this button needs more affordance.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Three levels of knowing:</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Simplicity</strong> is the world view of the child or uninformed adult, fully engaged in his own experience and happily unaware of what lies beneath the surface of immediate reality.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Complexity</strong> characterizes the ordinary adult world view. It is characterized by an awareness of complex systems in nature and society but an inability to discern clarifying patterns and connections.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Informed simplicity</strong> is an enlightened view of reality. It is founded upon an ability to discern or create clarifying patterns within complex mixtures. Pattern recognition is a crucial skill for an architect, who must create a highly ordered building amid many competing and frequently nebulous design considerations.&#8221;</em></p>
